# Endstations

Different endstations can be positioned into the beam interaction position on rails transverse to the FEL beam propagation direction. Those can be the flexible Bernina Diffractometer platforms, but also special user-provided equipment.    

## Diffractoeter configurations
Two similar main endstation platforms are presently available at Bernina:
- Xray diffractometer (XRD) with two detector circles.
- General purpose station (GPS) with a single detector circle.
Additionally to detector circles, the endstations include a heavy load vertical axis sample rotation.
Both endstations may be entirely translated trnasvere and vertically with respect to the FEL beam as well as rotated, in order to account for angular pointing changes induced by KB mirror focusing. 

Following Diffractometer configurations can be combined for experiments at Bernina:

## Bernina standard configurations

### Surface diffractometer

### THC Vacuum chamber (low Temperature, high Thz field excitation and tender X-ray)

## X-ray analyzer options
### Dispersive X-ray emission analysis
(Von Hamos crystals)
### Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering analyzer
(Dicesd crystal analyzer setup in polarisation)
