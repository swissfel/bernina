# Bernina beamline configuration
The Bernina instrument is using the output of the center line at the hard-Xray undulator line ARAMIS of SwissFEL.
The experiment beamline is parallely offset by vertically 20 mm from the direct undulator line by either reflecting Molybdenum coated Si offset mirrors in 
- "pink" mode: full FEL SASE Bandwidth
  - typically 0.15-0.2% Bandwidth
  - large Bandwidth mode 
- monochromatic mode
  - Si(111)/Si(333) double crystal monochromator (1.3×10^-4^/9×10^-8^ BW)
  - Si(311) double crystal monochromator (2.8×10^-5^ BW)
