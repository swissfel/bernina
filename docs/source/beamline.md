# Bernina beamline
## X-ray optical configuration
![alt text](img/beamline.png)
The Bernina instrument is using the output of the center line at the hard-Xray undulator line ARAMIS of SwissFEL.
The experiment beamline is vertically offset from the direct undulator line by 20 mm:
- "Pink" mode using molybdenum coated Si offset mirrors
  - full FEL SASE Bandwidth
  - typically 0.15-0.2% Bandwidth (BW)
  - large Bandwidth mode up to 2% BW
- Monochromatic mode
  - Si(111)/Si(333) double crystal monochromator (1.3×10<sup>-4</sup>/9×10<sup>-8</sup> BW)
  - Si(311) double crystal monochromator (2.8×10<sup>-5</sup> BW)

At the experimental location the FEL beam has a size of about 1 to 0.5 mm  size (fwhm) over the ARAMIS energy range of 2 to 12 keV. 

The beam can be focused by Kirpatrick-Baez bendable mirror pair (Mo-coated Si) to custom spot size at the sample interaction point, ranging from best fucus below 2 µm to the full SASE beam size.
