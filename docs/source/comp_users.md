# Computing @ Bernina

Most tools for experiment control, data acquisition and data analysis are python based at Bernina. Other frameworks and tools can typically interfaced to by different means, please contact the beamline for discussion (bernina@psi.ch).

## python installation

Anaconda python environments are used to run the majority of Bernina routines, most of which are built from a standalone anaconda installation. 
As those environments are subject to regular changes, it is highly advised that users install the current version in the experiment folder. Such makes the install static compared to the dynamic evolution of the Bernina environments and allows for independent user packages that might be required for the experiment or data analysis.
